        <p class="lead mb-4">As a student bank teller, I processed transactions for students and teachers on the school campus. Assisted with the workload incurred in the bank and attended meetings. Presented financial literacy to students across different classes and created visuals to advertise the bank. Persuaded students to open bank accounts to meet the bank sales goal. At the same time, I was also enrolled in a senior seminar class where I focused on researching and experimenting with participants to answer a particular question. I concluded my research with presentations to professional individuals who specialize in certain research fields. During this time I was able to improve my interviewing skills and was able to digest the information I was actually given. With my group members' help, we also created a well-organized procedure for data gathering to avoid bias or inaccurate results in our testing. Developed by speech skills to prepare a flawless presentation. Along with our presentation due, I also researched to back up our claims and research through a lab paper. The finished lab ended up with around a 30-page paper of factual information from professional journals or past research.

        During my time working at a restaurant, I operated the cash register and clarified any customer questions. I have complied with any demand needed from customers in an enthusiastic manner. Cleaned and prepared tables in an organized orientation. Maintained consistent service throughout customers' dining. During my downtime, I helped move heavy loads of supplies throughout the restaurant. I also managed online food delivery systems such as Postmates and Uber Eats. Using my personal technology experience, I constructed our ordering system and clarified the menu with translation as it was a Chinese restaurant. This allowed for more sales and exposure as the websites were more clean and easy to access. Issues within online ordering companies required phone calls, and I was the one to take the calls. Being able to translate what the owner of the restaurant wanted to be allowed for better communication between the restaurant and the online service.

       I was a member of a volunteering program in my local community. To become a member, I attended all the meetings where they would announce future events and plans for the programs. I participated in volunteering events and served in different roles. Roles such as simply cutting flowers among other volunteers for a flower parade. Supported any other areas where help was needed and acted as a flex worker. Volunteered for hours in events starting at 4 A.M. as water stands in a marathon. During these events, the weather would always be extreme as some events took place during the Summer. Enduring either hot or cold weather, we also did both the set ups of the events and the clean-up. Moving our tables of such back to the trucks or cleaning up the mess created when decorating flower displays took the cooperation of everyone involved. I also partook in spreading the program to students at my school in hopes of more members participating in volunteering for the better good of the community.
